# Infinite Python Quine Collection

This repository contains two Python programs that demonstrate self-replicating code (Quines):

1. **Simple Quine** (`simple_quine.py`)  
   Writes a copy of itself as `clone.py`.

2. **Infinite Cloning Quine** (`infinite_quine.py`)  
   Creates an infinite number of clones named `clone_0.py`, `clone_1.py`, etc.

## Usage

Run either script with Python 3:

```bash
python3 simple_quine.py

or

python3 infinite_quine.py

Warning
These programs can produce many files and fill your disk if run repeatedly.
Use responsibly.
